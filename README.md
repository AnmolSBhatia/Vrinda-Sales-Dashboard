# Vrinda-Sales-Dashboard

Objective- vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022, so that Vrinda can understand their customers and grow more sales in coming year.
In the beginning I cleaned the dataset by removing data duplicates, formatted the data according to the requirements. Then I performed data preprocessing to answer the questions to my analysis. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I performed data analysis and constructed various pivot tables and from those created a dashboard for Sales Analysis.
Various insights from the data-:
  Women are more likely to buy compared to men.
  Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and tamil Nadu are the top 5 states.
  Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra are the most contributing channels.
  Middle aged group (30-50 years) are the most active buyers.
